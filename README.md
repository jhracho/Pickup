### About
For our semester project, we designed a web app that works to connect Notre Dame students who want to play casual pickup sports games. The web app, titled “Pickup”, provides a platform for students to create and search for games, organize teams, and communicate about planned games. Using Flask, we developed a RESTful API that offers login/signup services as well as game and team access and manipulation. We leveraged React and React-Bootstrap to build a frontend that includes Landing, Home, Games, Teams, Profile, and Login/Signup pages. With protected routes, we prevent unauthorized users from accessing the Home, Games, and Teams pages. Finally, we were able to implement email notifications which updates users when relevant athletes join/leave/update games and teams. Additionally, users can add themselves to a game waitlist and be notified via email when a spot becomes available for a game. In all, building Pickup was an incredible learning opportunity for us; we were able to gain valuable experience with React, advanced database calls, API development, deployment, and working as a team.
